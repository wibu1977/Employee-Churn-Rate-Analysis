Employee Churn Analysis

Employee churn analysis is vital for businesses aiming to retain top talent. This project leverages data analysis techniques to understand the factors contributing to employee churn and predict potential future churn using historical data. In this blog, we'll walk through the project stages, demonstrating how code and data can be used to derive actionable insights.

1. Data Retrieval Using BigQuery
To analyze employee churn, we first connect to the BigQuery database and extract relevant datasets. The datasets include historical HR data, which is critical for understanding employee demographics, roles, and turnover trends.

python
Copy code
# Connect to BigQuery
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.colab import auth

# Authenticate
auth.authenticate_user()

# Initialize the client for BigQuery
project_id = 'churn-cloud-project-431011'
client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id, location='US')

# Get the dataset
dataset_ref = client.dataset('employeedata', project='churn-cloud-project-431011')
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
table_ref = dataset.table('tbl_hr_data')
table = client.get_table(table_ref)
In this code snippet, we authenticate and set up a BigQuery client to access the employee data stored in the cloud.

2. Data Exploration
Data exploration helps us understand the structure and contents of the dataset. We examine the schema to check data types and identify key columns such as employee tenure, department, and exit reasons.

python
Copy code
# Display the schema of the HR data table
table.schema
This gives an overview of the dataset's fields, helping us identify the data points available for analysis. The fields may include columns like Employee ID, Age, Department, Tenure, Salary, and Churn Status.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before diving into analysis, data cleaning is performed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats. Proper preprocessing ensures accurate analysis results.

python
Copy code
# Example of handling missing values
import pandas as pd

# Convert BigQuery table to a Pandas DataFrame
query = """
SELECT * FROM `churn-cloud-project-431011.employeedata.tbl_hr_data`
"""
df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()

# Drop rows with missing values in critical columns
df = df.dropna(subset=['Age', 'Tenure', 'Department'])

# Display cleaned data
df.head()
The above code demonstrates how to clean the dataset by removing rows with missing data in essential columns like Age, Tenure, and Department.

4. Churn Analysis and Feature Engineering
We perform analysis to find patterns in the data. Feature engineering involves creating new variables that better capture the trends in employee churn, such as converting tenure from months to years.

python
Copy code
# Convert Tenure from months to years
df['Tenure_Years'] = df['Tenure'] / 12

# Feature engineering for churn prediction
df['Is_High_Salary'] = df['Salary'] > 70000  # Example feature indicating high salary employees
By creating features like Tenure_Years and Is_High_Salary, we improve the model's ability to predict whether an employee will churn.

5. Predictive Modeling
We use machine learning models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to predict employee churn based on the features. Training and testing the model help validate its accuracy.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df[['Age', 'Tenure_Years', 'Is_High_Salary']]
y = df['Churn']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
This code trains a Random Forest model to predict churn. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Insights and Recommendations
The model's predictions can be used to identify employees at risk of churning. By understanding the key factors contributing to churn, such as lack of career growth or low salary, the company can take proactive measures to improve employee retention.

Conclusion
Employee churn analysis empowers organizations to retain valuable talent by understanding and addressing the factors that lead to turnover. Through this project, we demonstrated how data-driven insights can be extracted using tools like BigQuery and machine learning techniques.
