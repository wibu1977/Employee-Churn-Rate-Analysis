Project Introduction: Predicting Employee Churn with BigQuery and Google Colab
Overview
Hello, I'm excited to introduce my project on predicting employee churn, a critical aspect of workforce management. By leveraging the power of Google BigQuery and Google Colab, I've developed a robust model that helps organizations anticipate and mitigate employee turnover, ensuring a more stable and productive work environment.

Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict employee churn using key indicators such as satisfaction level, time spent at the company, and the number of projects handled. By doing so, companies can proactively address potential turnover issues, ultimately leading to improved employee retention and reduced hiring costs.

Tools and Technologies
Google BigQuery: Used for efficient data storage and processing, allowing for seamless handling of large datasets.
Google Colab: Utilized for model development and testing, providing an interactive environment for coding and collaboration.
Methodology
Data Preparation: The dataset was meticulously cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Model Development: A decision tree classifier was employed to build the predictive model. This choice was driven by its effectiveness in handling classification problems and its interpretability.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.
Key Features
Satisfaction Level: A crucial indicator of employee contentment and potential turnover risk.
Time Spent at Company: Provides insights into employee loyalty and tenure.
Number of Projects: Reflects workload and potential burnout, influencing churn rates.
Results
The model demonstrated impressive accuracy in predicting employee churn, offering valuable insights for organizations to enhance their retention strategies. By identifying at-risk employees early, companies can implement targeted interventions to improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover.

Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to apply advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business challenges. I'm eager to bring this expertise to your organization, helping you harness data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

Thank you for considering my project. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team's success.
